# TaskManagerSwiftUI
This repo was made to better understand how to use SwiftUI to make a more complex view, this app uses mock data to fill out a calendar. This app has a home screen and an add new event screen. Adding an event doesn't really do anything of note. I am going to work on going back in to fix that however.
